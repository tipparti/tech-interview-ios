# Technical Interview - iOS

## PURPOSE:
This demo app displays a simple UI consisting of two UIButtons and one UILabel.

The first button begins a countdown from 100 to 0, inclusive, that is displayed
by the UILabel above it.

The second button changes the background color of the UIView, cycling between Red, Green, Blue.

## OBJECTIVE:
Once the countdown has begun, the user should be able to continuously cycle through background colors without interrupting the countdown.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Do not make changes to the storyboard.
2. Add your name to the LaunchScreen where indicated.
3. Append your name to the project bundle identifier - `com.firstperformance.SwiftDemo.YOURNAME`.
4. Read all the comments and follow the instructions in `ViewController.swift`.

## DELIVERABLES:
Please zip the entire project directory and name it as `[first_name]_[last_name]_swiftDemo.zip`.
